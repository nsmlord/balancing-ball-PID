# Ball Balancing Platform Simulation with PID Control

This project is a computer simulation of a ball balancing platform controlled by a PID controller. The simulation models the dynamics of a ball rolling on a platform and uses different controllers (P, PD, PID) to stabilize the ball at a desired position.

The simulation includes progressively more advanced controllers, as well as testing environments for both physics and tuning.

## How to Run

Each file can be executed independently to test the specific control strategy it demonstrates.

Example:
```bash
python balancing_ball_PID_tuning.py
